# Burger-Stacker-React

https://burger-stacker-fgzde.ondigitalocean.app/

This app allows users to create a custom burger and order it. The user must authenticate to order. Once the user is logged in, they can also view prior orders. This application was built entirely in React and is connected to a Firebase database, using the out-of-the-box authentication. The React features used for this project include Redux and Routing.
